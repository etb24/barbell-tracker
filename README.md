# Barbell Path Tracker

As a former competitive athlete and fitness enthusiast with past injuries I've built a computer vision application that tracks and visualizes barbell movement patterns during weightlifting exercises. Perfect for form analysis, coaching, and performance optimization.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native, Expo, TypeScript
- **Backend**: AWS, FastAPI, Python

## Features

- **Real-time Barbell Detection**: Uses computer vision to detect and track barbells in video
- **Path Visualization**: Draws a color-coded trail showing the barbell's movement path
- **Mobile App**: Mobile app built in React Native with Expo
- **Processing**: FastAPI REST API backend integrated with AWS S3 for file storage
- **Video Management**: Save videos to personal library in app or camera roll

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Containerized deployment on AWS EC2
- [ ] Cloud implementation for library storage
- [ ] Real-time streaming support
- [ ] Rep counting and velocity tracking
- [ ] Dashboard for analytics
- [ ] Form analysis and recommendations
